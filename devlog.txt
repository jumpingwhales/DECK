INITIAL DD REVIEW -- 2025-10-23 21:00
- some things easier said than done: using emails for auth is too complex, beyond our scope currently as mr. mykolyk said
- consider: when making component maps, double check relations for contradictions, cut unnecessary ones
- as many agree from REV's, better to be thorough and specific as possible with component explanations to see how pieces fit together, now rather than later when you're already DEV'ing
- inspiration: another group had logout.html page, pretty logical; maybe we should also implement that (if not, redirect to homepage?)
